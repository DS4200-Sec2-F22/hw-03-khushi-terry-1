                <h3>Marks</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Lines (Electoral votes needed to win)</li>
                  <li>Area (Map of the US)</li>
                  <li>Points (Nebraska and Maine electoral votes)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Channels</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Positions on horizontal scale (quantitative - number of electoral votes)
                    <ul><li>Use of position was an effective representation as 
                      the human perceptual judgment can estimate length correctly 
                      and in combination with hue, categories are fully separable. </li></ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Color hue (categorical - Trump vs Clinton)
                    <ul><li>Effective use of hue as the colors are intuitive to users and 
                      matches how one would interpret the data and each category is easily 
                      discriminable. The use of color hue takes advantage of grouping that 
                      adds to its efficacy.  </li></ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Spatial region (categorical - states)
                    <ul><li>Effective use of spatial regions because users would naturally
                       interpret a map in this way. </li></ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Area/length (number of electoral votes in Nebraska and Maine)
                    <ul><li>Effective use of the channel because the audience can easily 
                      dentify how many electoral votes from each party go towards the total 
                      for each state. The data is easily separable between hue and overall 
                      length/area that represents each electoral vote.  </li></ul>

              <h3>Marks</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Points (batted balls)</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Channels</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Both positions (ordered quantitative: exit velocity - x and launch angle - y)
                  <ul><li>Effective representation of quantitative data. 
                    User can infer that higher up and further right imply higher quantities.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Color hue (categorical:above and below average)
                  <ul><li>This is an effective channel for representing categorical data; 
                    however, colors could be chosen closer to human intuition with above 
                    and below average (e.g. green vs red) and use of a different color than white 
                    (which is often associated with no data) could be used to represent average. 
                    Overall, the data still displays distinguishable groups and is quite effective.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Spatial region (categorical : pop-ups, fly balls, line drives, ground balls)
                  <ul><li>Effective, spatial region is used to represent categorical data, 
                    and the lines help distinguish what category each batted ball falls into. </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Saturation (ordered quantitative: scoring value of batted balls made at each launch angle and exit velocity)
                  <ul><li>Effective as human natural tendency 
                    is to consider points that or more saturated to have more in quantity.</li></ul>
                </li>

              <h3>Colormap</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Divergent
                  <ul><li>Effective representation of ordered quantitative data points, and conveys extremes in data well (above vs below). 
                    High saturation in the divergent map could skew perception.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Sequential
                  <ul><li>Sequential color map is a bit misleading as saturation from 
                    below average to average actually decreases as the score increases. However, the mapping is still suggests the differing scores to the audience. </li></ul>
